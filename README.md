# 📌 Pin to Progress 🚀 – Daily Task Manager (with Theme Support)

**Pin to Progress** is a lightweight and responsive to-do list web app built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** – all embedded in a single `.html` file. It allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks with support for dark and light themes.

## ✨ Features

* 📝 **Add & Remove Tasks** – Type your tasks and manage them interactively
* ✅ **Mark as Done** – Check off tasks as you complete them (visual strike-through)
* 🌗 **Theme Toggle** – Switch between light mode and dark mode
* 🖼️ **Dynamic Background** – Background changes based on the selected theme:

  * ☀️ Light Mode: `todobg1.webp`
  * 🌙 Dark Mode: `tododarkbg1.webp`
* 📱 **Fully Responsive** – Looks great on all screen sizes
* 💾 **Single-File Project** – All logic and styling are inside `PinToProgress.html`

## ⚙️ How It Works

2. JavaScript handles user input, list rendering, and interaction events
3. The theme toggle dynamically changes the background image and text styles

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5 (structure)
* CSS3 (embedded styling)
* JavaScript (vanilla, embedded script)
